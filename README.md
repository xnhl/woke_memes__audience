- # The Audience
	- ## The Trickster (memers)
		- "Dank shit! Cheers, bruv!"
		- "Danke!"
	- ## The Acolyte (woke)
		- Apoplexy
		- Sobbing
		- Tantrums
		- Swearing revenge
		- Attempting to make plans for the usual anti-fascist attacks which will surely accomplish their goals:
			- Censorship
			- Violence
			- Threats on social media
			- Private death threats
			- Character assassination
			- [Doxxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing)
			- [SWATting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting)
			- False reports to law enforcement and any employers they can find
			- ~~<i>et cetera</i>~~ <i>eksetra</i>
		- "Any of the reactions/attacks above might prove that he's right about how predictable we are and confirm that this MAGA fascist is a threat to our ideology, so maybe we should instead try to save face by doing nothing and pretending that we aren't watching him and that he means nothing to us."
		- At the end of a long day of fighting fascists and putting the Allied troops of D-Day to shame they can pat themselves on the back once again for being The Good Guys who are all about love, tolerance, coexistence, anti-aggression, and freedom from rules & rulers.
		- The dissenter: "Fuck. He's right about at least most of it. We're angry and ignorant and full of shit like most young people in history, we're being led around by the worst among us just like most of the older generations have been, we're transparent to those who are more experienced, our profoundly embarrassing performative nonsense will be remembered forever by the internet, and we've got a bit of lernin' to do before we try changing the world again."
	- ## The Foreign Agitator (possibly China / Indonesia)
		- On April 17 at 2:30am PST I received an obvious phishing attempt at an old e-mail address which I used to register a newer GitHub account for my portfolio.
			- This event occurred roughly 16 days after posting the new woke meme repositories (Apr 1 2025) and no other e-mails have been received at this address for many years, so these events must be related.
				- At this point it's clear that the attacks against me must be a reaction to my anti-woke position, and I thank the donkey-brained dummies who are initiating them for doing all they can to help prove that I'm right.
			- It is not difficult to get a GitHub user's e-mail address, and my GitHub account is on my LinkedIn page, so this is not surprising and does not require any skill on the part of those responsible. 
			- I have made some screenshots of the e-mail which I received. They can be found in the images folder in this repository.
			- In one screenshot you'll see that there is what appears to be an IP address in the "to:" field of the e-mail address information. I did an IP address lookup for 198.142.125.28 and found that it was registered to Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) in South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (more information available in phishing_email_ip_address.txt in the files folder in this repository).
				- This attack could have been initiated by someone in Australia but I imagine that an Asian country is more likely.
				- The timezone in this area of Australia is 18 hours ahead of California, so since the e-mail was received at 2:30am on April 17 that would make it roughly 8:30pm at the time that it was sent.
				- IP address registered to Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, region of world in close proximity to China and Indonesia, the furry h4x0r MrXyfir (from fan-mail repository) is Indonesian. Could be related.
			- I decided to check the web for similar e-mails and found a recent [news article](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/apr/22/email-pretending-google-subpoena-alert-phishing-scam/) in <i>The Washington Times</i> about people receiving phishing e-mails pretending to be from Google.
			- Could be related to fan-mail repository stuff (MrXyfir the woke Indonesian furry & 1337 h4x0r)
			- China and Indonesia seem likely possible origins of at least some attacks.
		- "This woke bullshit is pretty great!"
			- Help West cripple themselves by replacing meritocracy with unqualified 'diversity'
			- Encourage superior collectivist thinking instead of degenerate Western freedom and individualism
			- Further divide and polarize Western populations in order to stall/prevent/reverse progress while we move ahead
			- Heretical non-believers are blacklisted, exiled, and fired from jobs/careers and positions of power/influence if they refuse brainwashing
			- Encourage deconstruction of Western language and attempts to redefine basic words and concepts in order to help cause confusion
				- 2 + 2 = 5
				- "A woman is anyone who feels like a woman!"
			- Send infiltrators to sneak in through open borders and/or take advantage of 'diversity' hiring and throw wrenches into the machines
				- Is their southern border still being held open by useful idiots / traitors who have allowed thousands of illegal immigrants/criminals to pour through daily for months? Excellent opportunity there. 
					- Hundreds of thousands of these criminals were even made citizens and given a bunch of free stuff (in order to help ensure that they will vote blue) which was paid for with money which was effectively stolen from <i>actual</i> citizens! Citizens are <i>paying</i> these criminals to help choke their system! Brilliant!
			- Create thousands (or why not tens/hundreds of thousands?) of online bots to support and spread woke madness & disinformation
				- If we flood the internet with enough disinformation then we may be able to change the minds of some of the troublesome 'fReE sPeEcH' and anti-censorship degenerates.
				- Far-left/leftists are predictably so worried about & focused on 'far-right disinformation' that they totally ignore the possibility that they could be targets of disinfo campaigns.
					- They are <i>far</i> too intelligent to <i>ever</i> be fooled by such trickery.
					- Many leftists don't care about or believe in truth and would probably never admit it if they discovered that they were mistaken.
						- No matter how dumb, if it helps them to win then they will continue to believe it.
			- Destabilize West so East may crush them and rise as the top global superpower
			- West gets to continue feeling morally superior while oblivious to the fact that they are helping to destroy themselves
			- "Pro-West and anti-woke who see through this strategy and risk exposing it must be neutralized. The future of the hive may depend on it."
	- ## The Agent (woke + intelligence community)
		- "Is he a terrorist, can we nudge him into becoming one, or can we at least make it seem like he is (maybe through media mockingbirds) so that we can end this dissent?"
		- "He claims to oppose all racism but he also opposes anti-racism, which he sees as just more racism, which obviously makes him extremely racist."
		- "He opposes DEI and wokeness which means he is unlikely to follow orders/trends without thought or question or to bow to strong social pressure. Too individualistic, thinks too much, asks too many questions. A troublemaker."
		- "He refuses to regard the feelings and beliefs of others as always being paramount priorities (instead preferring 'tRuTh' and 'hOnEsTy') which means he is probably anti-social (psychopath, dangerous, clearly 0 empathy)."
		- "Representatives of numerous cells in our anti-fascist contacts have adamantly assured us no less than twenty times that this man is, in fact, a far-right fascist MAGA white supremacist extremist terrorist whom they have witnessed assaulting peaceful antifa protestors at events across the world."
		- "Our DEI department head has confirmed that anyone who opposes DEI/wokeness is, without a doubt, a fascist white supremacist terrorist, an imminent threat to national security, and has forfeited their rights. Xhe has provided a list of 132 media/scholarly sources which support xher claim. Our lawyers have prepared a statement and we're ready to speak to one of our favorable judges in order to obtain a warrant and collect this terrorist and his possessions."
		- "Our lead disinformation expert is currently out on his pregnancy leave and due to give birth at any moment (remember that the gender reveal party won't be held until his child has chosen their gender, so we may have to wait a few months!), but before leaving he expressed extreme concern about the flood of illegal hate speech and mis/dis/malinformation that this fascist is spewing everywhere."
		- "He imagines that Western society is not racist, fascist, or white supremacist but rather that 'it opposes those -isms and is the best system that's currently available despite its flaws and infiltration by malevolent psychopaths and well-meaning but ignorant and misguided fools who, along with the obedient hordes of common morons who follow and support them, have given the West a bad reputation', and that it's 'not the thing itself but the thing that gets us to the thing' whatever the fuck <i>that</i> means. Delusional. What else can you expect from a racist white boy who doesn't see how our whole society is set up to benefit privileged <i>hwite</i> pieces of shit like him and oppress superior BIPOC folx?"
		- "He makes fun of Feminism and treats Womxn and BIPOC folx as if they're ordinary people who are as flawed and fallible as anyone else instead of giving them the extraordinary respect, honor, and admiration that they all deserve for the suffering that they and all of their ancestors have had to go through for millions of years because of whites (and especially white men). This clearly indicates that he must be a racist, misogynist, men's rights activist type incel who glorifies Andrew Tate."
		- "He refuses to accept that trans people are the sex they claim to be or to treat them with the extraordinary respect that they deserve because of the persecution that they have all had to endure since the dawn of time. He imagines that they're mentally ill (at best), that it is tyrannical to attempt to require the whole world to involuntarily participate in their 'delusions', and that, intentionally or not, they are part of an insane cult intent on destroying Western society. This can only mean that he wants to commit genocide against trans people. Therefore, any violence against him is merely justified self-defense to stop him before he goes through with his Final Solution."
		- "He imagines that 'humans have natural rights to fReE ExPrEsSiOn and pRiVaCy which are correctly acknowledged by the first and fourth amendments to the United States Constitution and which the government is, for the most part, prohibited from infringing upon despite frequently behaving as if such rules should not apply to them' which means that he is clearly one of those 'CoNsTiTuTiOn' people, he imagines that free speech gives him the right to be offensive and to contradict trendy political activists, and he's a far-right extremist who wouldn't know fascism if it hit him in the face (which we <i>should</i> do until he's able to learn his lesson or until our sadism can be sated). <b>Who else but a tyrannical authoritarian fascist would want everyone to be able to freely express themselves as well as be safe from unreasonable/unwarranted searches and seizures by governments?</b>"
		- "He is interested in and familiar with encryption and encoding but it couldn't just be a genuine interest that he's exploring. Some ignorant colleagues of mine believe that he's just playing games with us because he's been aware for a while that he's being watched, he insists that people have a NaTuRaL RiGhT to privacy and refuses to accept that only governments and law enforcement should have access to encryption, the 'nothing to hide, nothing to fear' routine doesn't work on him, and he's a paranoid fool who imagines that we aren't trustworthy because of 'decades of highly illegal and treasonous abuses of power without consequence' or some such nonsense. The real reason for all of these games must be that he's a white supremacist terrorist who is probably planning an attack on the whole galaxy so he can create a fascist empire and enslave us all."
		- "He wants to trick us into believing that he's just an innocent coder seeking a job and a relatively normal life and is tragically overlooked and held back because of 'sYsTeMiC RaCiSm' against whites and 'AnTi-MeRiToCrAtiC DiVeRsiTy HiRiNg' (which he imagines have become especially egregious in tech fields and deep blue states like California, in which 'RaCiSt' and 'illegal' practices like this are encouraged and seldom prosecuted), and he's 'just making jokes' (which are <i>ackshually</i> fascist dog whistles and violent genocidal attacks against the 2SLGBTQIAMNOPWXYZ+ community), but <i>we</i> know better. Whites can't experience racism. He's just another lazy, stupid, privileged, entitled, delusional, paranoid white boy with a persecution fetish, and he's mad that he's finally getting what he deserves for slavery and all of the things that whites have done. He <i>must</i> be planning something. <i>Whites</i>, am I right? The sooner they and their culture are extinct, the better off the planet will be."
		- "My less intelligent colleagues mistakenly imagine that the purpose of this document is to poke fun at us even more in a futile attempt to penetrate our superior cranial <b>thiccness</b> [is that a phrenological joke or are we proving his point by assuming that it's a racial thing?] and show that its author possesses senses of humor and self-awareness which would seem likely to preclude violent nature/desires which we're desperate to find in order to justify our prejudice and proceed further with our plans, and instead illustrate his insistence on problem-solving with words and intelligence rather than violence, but <i>I</i> know better. That's just what this violent, genocidal, misogynistic, transphobic, far-right MAGA fascist extremist <i>wants</i> us to think. My dumb colleagues don't know how lucky they are that they have me around to interpret all of this for them."
		- "The only reasonable response if our covert efforts to drive oppressive and disruptive whites like him to insanity, bankruptcy, and total ruin are unsuccessful is to indefinitely detain him in a black site and start with a first course of some delightful <i>enhanced interrogation</i> to find out about his fascist network (which probably extends all the way to Drumpf). If that doesn't work then we can move him offshore where we're not legally forbidden from torture and/or just outsource the work to partners like we always do with domestic surveillance efforts which would otherwise be illegal. If it turns out that in a decade or two he's still alive and conscious (more or less) and we have found nothing then we can always let him go back to his old life, no harm no foul, though an unmarked grave somewhere out in the middle of nowhere is usually less troublesome. Even better: the evergreen tragic and inexplicable heart attack at a young age may leave fewer questions than a simple disappearance. Even better: just plant some illegal stuff on his hard drive, call in a tip, and let cops and the prison system take care of him and save us the (wet) work. This might seem distasteful to some, but keep in mind that we're The Good Guys and it ain't easy defending <i>our</i> democracy. This is all necessary, and it's our cross to bear for the greater good. You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break a few innocent people."
		- The dissenter, who sees what's happening but dares not jeopardize their life, family, and career just yet by expressing an opinion which contradicts The Narrative (especially in a field that can be so complex, dangerous, ruthless), thinks to themself: "Oh <i>shit</i>! He's <i>right</i>! Tens (if not hundreds) of millions of people, including many of my colleagues, seem to be hopelessly insane / brainwashed, at best. SNAFU. How did things get this far? How do we begin to untangle this mess and purge the anti-Western suicide cult that is the woke mind virus from our essential institutions before they are irreparably infiltrated and either destroyed or made to c/overtly serve our adversaries who wish to help us cripple ourselves (by replacing meritocracy with skin-deep 'diversity', for example) so that they might more easily conquer us and forever snuff out the vision of the West in favor of their (probably much more tyrannical) vision? It's too bad, though understandable, that this amateur seems inclined to decline, were we to offer him some kind of position. He could potentially offer some valuable insights and be a useful asset (probably even better after some formal training), he seems to be passionate and patriotic and skilled and bright (not to mention quite humble and an excellent judge of character), and he just might possess a type of mind and personality naturally suited to this line of work. If nothing else maybe it's better that we at least try to recruit him before someone else does."
